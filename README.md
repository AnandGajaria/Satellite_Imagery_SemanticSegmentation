# Satellite_Imagery_SemanticSegmentation
## Motivation
The primary objective of this project revolves around tackling the complexities associated with training deep learning algorithms on large images, particularly when facing resource constraints. The ultimate goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of effective strategies for handling these challenges. By delving into this endeavor, I aim to shed light on the performance analysis of diverse deep learning algorithms when trained on processed large-scale images.Working with large images in training deep learning models for semantic segmentation poses several challenges. Firstly, the memory demands of these images often surpass the available GPU memory capacity, making it difficult to load and process them entirely.  Secondly, the computational workload associated with forward and backward passes through a deep neural network with large images is high. Training on such data can extend the model development process. Lastly, memory constraints often lead to the reduction of batch sizes during training. Smaller batches are used to fit within the available memory, but this reduction can result in less stable training dynamics and slower convergence rates, potentially impeding the learning process.
